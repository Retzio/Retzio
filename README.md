## Python<a id=2.2></a>
### Python GLPK Solver

I created a DraftKings NHL fantasy lineup using GLPK Solver. For the DraftKings NHL fatasy lineup contest you are a given a set of constrainst to build a fantasy team. To view all the rules, points, and contraints, see [DraftKings](https://www.draftkings.com/help/rules/3). Using GLPK I created the best posiible team based each player's current season stats. Becuase this was just for fun and based on a contest that had alreadt happened, I created a second lineup for what the best possible team would have been based on the games for the contest. The results for the predicted and actual optimal can be seen below.
